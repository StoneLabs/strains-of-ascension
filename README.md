# Strains of Ascension

Server side mod inspired by Made in Abyss. The deeper you go, the more taxing it becomes. Will you survive?

This mod includes strains that will make the depth far more dangerous. Additionally, there are artifacts you can find that will help you explore and fight. And even a boss. All mechanics of the mod are described in lore books. You can find those throughout the world. Looking stuff up (i.e. in [the wiki](https://github.com/StoneLabs/strains-of-ascension/wiki)) is not necessary. The exception to that being, of course, if you want more technical knowledge of the mechanics.

It is important to note: This mod is currently for dedicated servers only. Meaning that if you want to run this mod in singleplayer, you have to launch a fabric server locally and connect to it localhost.

## Important Config options

By default the mod will be in depth mode. Meaning, unlike in made in abyss you will get strains/effects based on depth. If you want to only get the strains when ascending, you have to use the following command:

`/gamerule doStrainsOnAscension true`

## Download

You can download the latest version of the mod [here](https://github.com/StoneLabs/strains-of-ascension/releases/latest).

## Wiki

There is a [small wiki](https://github.com/StoneLabs/strains-of-ascension/wiki) with some more technical information. However, it is NOT necessary to look at the wiki to play the mod. In fact, I strongly recommend not to.
